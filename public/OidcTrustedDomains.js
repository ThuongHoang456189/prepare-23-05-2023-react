// OidcTrustedDomains.js

// Add bellow trusted domains, access tokens will automatically injected to be send to
// trusted domain can also be a path like https://www.myapi.com/users,
// then all subroute like https://www.myapi.com/useers/1 will be authorized to send access_token to.

// Domains used by OIDC server must be also declared here
const trustedDomains = {
    default: ["https://localhost:44351","https://localhost:44348/api"],

// Service worker will continue to give access token to the JavaScript client
// Ideal to hide refresh token from client JavaScript, but to retrieve access_token for some
// scenarios which require it. For example, to send it via websocket connection.
